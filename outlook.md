BitShares market pegged assets are a viable open source alternative to the incumbent banking system.  Achieving price parity with a commonly used currency facilitates pricing and acceptance by merchants.  Additionally it reduces the need to calculate capital gains and losses on volatile assets to determine tax liability.  While certain risks of the system have been outlined, no system is without risk.

The current banking system allows private funds to be frozen or confiscated without consent, such as by court order or administrative actions.  Banks and financial institutions are susceptible to insolvency.  The availability and quality of banking service varies greatly throughout the world.

BitShares brings publically auditable open source banking to anyone with access to the internet.  Market pegged assets allow savers and spenders to choose preferred asset types.

This brings flexibility and ease of use to the open source banking experience.
